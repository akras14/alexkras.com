**Old Post - X Takeaways from Famo.us Training at HTML5 Developers Conference**

Yesterday, I attended Famo.us full day training event at HTML5 conference. Bellow, is the summary of the key takeaways that I made for myself.

## 1. Famo.us is Cool

I saw Famo.us receiving a lot of criticism lately on various social media sites. While I tend to agree with most of complains, I think they are missing the big picture. In my opinion, Famo.us is a great step in the right direction for the web as a whole.

### Complaint A. Scrollbar Experience Sucks

I agree 100%. Scroll bar experience does suck. It feels un-natural and off. But, that is just a tweak-able user experience. That does not mean that underlying mechanism behind is sucks, it just means that they need to do more work to polish their user experience.

### Complaint B. Too Much Hype

I also agree, Famo.us was a bit overhyped. That being said, as a former co-founder of a [start up](http://www.digispoke.com/) that failed to raise money, I completely understand the importance of hype.

Whether you like it or not, innovation takes money. And investors don't like giving their money away to just anybody, they want to see big vision, they want to see media coverage, and they want to see signs of early traction.

Just having a good vision is not enough. Executing on a big vision is a whole different story.

In his book, "Behind the Cloud The Untold Story of How Salesforce.com Went from Idea to Billion-dollar Company-and Revolutionized an Industry" Marc Benioff tells of various hype generating tactics that he used, including **paying actors to stage fake protests and competitor's conferences**.

In the real world, it takes hype to get and make money, and it takes money(in one way or another) to bring innovation.

### Complaint C. Famo.us is not Open Source

Famo.us is now open source. It is released under MPL-2.0. You can read more here: [https://github.com/Famous/famous#licensing-information](https://github.com/Famous/famous#licensing-information)

### Complain D. Famo.us Performs Poorly on Desktop Apps

I don't think the idea behind of Famo.us is to revolutionize the desktop world, although it may appear so at the first glance.

Most of us have lived through the browser revolution that took over the desktop world. I believe that the mobile world is due for a similar take over. As a developer I don't want to deal with long review cycles of apple, and a as a user I don't want to download a new app for every little thing that I want to do with my phone.

Unfortunately, as the technology stands today, mobile browsers are not capable of performing a lot of tasks that are possible to native apps. That is why I am so excited to see companies like Famo.us.

I don't know if Famo.us is THE company to revolutionize the mobile world, but I do believe that without companies like Famo.us such revolution would not be possible.

To me, Famo.us is a polyfill technology for the mobile web, it helps to take us from where we are today to where we want to go. And just like CoffeScript affected the development of standards for ECMA Script 6 (a.k.a. JavaScript) I believe Famo.us can help to shape the future of the mobile web.

## 2. Getting Started with Famo.us

While Famo.us inspires to be as user friendly as jQuery, they still have a long way to go, and they know it. That being said, I think their training documentation is great, and their sample exercises are very helpful.

As of yesterday, they released a lot of material to help you get started. They have also recorder their all day training session yesterday and I am guessing they will be making that available sometime int he future, so be on a lookout for that.

### a. [Famous Guides](https://famo.us/guides)

Based on what I learned yesterday, I think the best place to get started with Famo.us is their "guides" available on their sites. Read through them before you attempt to do any tutorials. Famo.us is taking an unusual approach to mobile web development, and it will help a lot to read through their guides to help you wrap your mind around "Famo.us" way of doing things.

#### Some concepts that stood out for me:

1. All Elements are Absolutely Positioned
2. Flat DOM Structure for ease of traversal
3. [The Famo.us Render Tree](https://famo.us/guides/dev/render-tree.html)
4. [Common Pitfalls to Watch Out For](https://famo.us/guides/dev/pitfalls.html)

### b. [Famo.us University](https://famo.us/university)

I think it has a very clean UI and a great place to get started.

In class they went over a "Slideshow" tutorial. You can see the working demo by clicking on the image bellow:
