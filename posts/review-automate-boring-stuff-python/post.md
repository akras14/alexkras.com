I am new to Python, and I wanted an easy read that would give me a hight level overview of the language and how it can help make my life easier.

**Automate the Boring Stuff with Python** by Al Sweigart was exactly what I wanted.

 The book starts out a little slow, with Part I being dedicated to Python Programming Basics, with the emphasis on the *Programming Basics* part. Yet I've quickly read through it, because I wanted to familiarize myself with Python syntax. I've also picked out some of the gems that I would have missed otherwise, for example how to copy and paste into clipboard, how to join strings, etc.

## Examples of Automation
The author takes the reader through the following Automation subjects, with some of the examples that stood out for me:

1. **Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions**
  - Finding and replacing phone numbers, emails and urls in rage text files
1. **Reading and Writing Files**
  - Opening, Reading from and Saving data to Files
1. **Organizing Files**
  - Copying, renaming and deleting files
  - Listing files in folder and all folders inside that folder
  - Compressing and uncompressing files (i.e. creating ZIP files)
1. **Debugging**
1. **Web Scraping**
  - Scrape and parse HTML to extract all images from all pages from a web site
  - Use a Selenium module to automate opening browsers and navigating and interacting with web pages (i.e. filling out forms)
1. **Working with Excel Spreadsheets**
  - Opening, reading data from and writing data to Excel files
1. **Working with PDF and Word Documents**
  - Extracting text from PDFs
  - Combining multiple PDF files into one
  - Creating and styling a word document
1. **Working** with CSV Files and JSON Data
  - Simple example of reading, parsing and saving the data
1. **Keeping Time, Scheduling Tasks, and Launching Programs**
  - Time tracking Modules
  - Example of a Multithreaded program to fetch data from various pages on a website.
1. **Sending Email and Text Messages**
  - Connecting to email server to send and receive Messages
  - Using Twilio Module/API to send text messages to yourself to notify when a long running process is done running
1. **Manipulating Images**
  - Adding a logo to each image in a folder
1. **Controlling the Keyboard and Mouse with GUI Automation**
  - Writing code to click around your desktop and type text, allowing to automate virtually any software that your computer can run.
