I am new to Python, and I wanted an easy read that would give me a hight level overview of the language and how it can help make my life easier.

**Automate the Boring Stuff with Python** by Al Sweigart was exactly what I wanted.

 The book starts out a little slow, with Part I being dedicated to Python Programming Basics, with the emphasis on the *Programming Basics* part. Yet I've quickly read through it, because I wanted to familiarize myself with Python syntax. I've also picked out some of the gems that I would have missed otherwise, for example how to copy and paste into clipboard, how to join strings, etc.

## Examples of Automation
