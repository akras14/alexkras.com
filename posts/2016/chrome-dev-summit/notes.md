#  Notes from the 2016 Chrome Dev Summit

Two weeks ago I got to attend the Chrome Dev Summit, an annual two-day conference
hosted by Google where they announced latest developments relevant to the web
technology. Here are my full notes from this conference. Since there was so
much information presented, I decided to organize it by subject, instead of
chronological order of talks presented.

talks.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNYkxOF6rcIBTs2KPy1E6tIYaWoFcG3uj)

## Statistics and Charts

  * Over 2 Billion Chrome Browsers worldwide across desktop and mobile
  * 53% of users say they will leave a site if it‚Äôs not loaded in 3 seconds or less
  * Mobile Stats
    * 19 seconds ‚Äì average mobile page load time
    * 77% of mobile sites take 10+ seconds to load
    * 214 server requests per mobile web page
  * Housing.com reports user acquisition costs ‚Äì $3.75 mobile install vs $0.07 Progressive Web App

## Progressive Web App

When I attended Chrome Dev Summit for the first time in 2014, my key complain
was ‚Äúthis is great, but all of the talks are about the mobile web.‚Äù This year,
Google pushed to get rid of this mentality, by calling everything (mobile and
desktop) a **Progressive Web App**.

Progressive Web App is a newish term, that according to [Mozilla Developer
Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Progressive) means:

  * Discoverable
  * Network Independent (Even offline)
  * Responsive
  * Installable
  * Works for every browser
  * Safe
  * Linkable
  * Re-engageable

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Progressive Web Apps as a term is new but the concept has been around for a very long time. Look at HTA <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/chromedevsummit?src=hash">#chromedevsummit</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickkettner">@patrickkettner</a></p>&mdash; Abraham Williams (@abraham) <a href="https://twitter.com/abraham/status/797228227945111553">November 12, 2016</a></blockquote>

**Progressive Web Apps takeaways**

  * Progressive Web App != Single Page Application
  * Progressive Web Apps = Smaller user acquisition funnel and faster updates (no need to wait for the App Store)
  * Older technology can be leveraged to provide Progressive Web App experience on all platforms today. If you are interested in supporting various platforms (including Mobile Safari) I highly recommend watching a talk by Patrick Kettner, Edge PM, Microsoft ‚Äì [The ‚ÄúProgressive‚Äù in Progressive Web Apps](https://youtu.be/ARkPBm6AcNA?list=PLNYkxOF6rcIBTs2KPy1E6tIYaWoFcG3uj)

## Tech

**Service Workers**

Service Workers (not to be confused with Web Workers) are a big deal. [MDN
defines Service Workers as follows](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API):

Service workers essentially act as proxy servers that sit between web
applications, and the browser and network (when available). They are intended
to (among other things) enable the creation of effective offline experiences,
intercepting network requests and taking appropriate action based on whether
the network is available and updated assets reside on the server. They will
also allow access to push notifications and background sync APIs.

I first learned of Service Workers when I attended Chrome Dev Summit in 2014.
At the time the support was limited to the latest Chrome. Things have improved
since then, with Chrome, Firefox and Opera having a full support, and Edge
actively working to add support.

Safari is the only browser without indication of planning to support Service
Worker, with only Mobile Safari being a big deal, since Desktop users have
other options.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Hundreds of millions of pages are loaded from ServiceWorker per day in Chrome&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChromeDevSummit?src=hash">#ChromeDevSummit</a></p>&mdash; Eric Lawrence (@ericlaw) <a href="https://twitter.com/ericlaw/status/797214344773668864">November 11, 2016</a></blockquote>

  * Thanks [Let‚Äôs Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
  * Service Workers, Push and other APIs are ONLY available over HTTPs

**Web Manifest**

MDN [defines Web Manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
US/docs/Web/Manifest) as follows:

The web app manifest provides information about an application (such as name,
author, icon, and description) in a text file. The purpose of the manifest is
to install web applications to the homescreen of a device, providing users
with quicker access and a richer experience.

Web Manifest is a must have for any installable (add to home screen etc)
Progressive Web App.

## Conclusion

I really enjoyed Chrome Dev Summit, even though it was a long two days.

It seems that Google is hyper aware of the current web trends. Modern web is
not ready for the mobile revolution and Google is very interested in changing
that status quo.

Even if your current business needs are not affected by the developing mobile
market, try to keep two things in mind.

  1. Business needs can change, sometimes really fast
  2. There are a number of benefits that Progressive Web Apps could provide for businesses that are not targeting the Mobile web at all (Caching, Push Notifications etc)

I think the Web will win if we all work together.
