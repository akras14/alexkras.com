I've had a number of posts make it to the front page of Hacker News in the past year, including:

- [I Tried to Virtually Stalk Mark Zuckerberg ](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11419800)
- [Git Tips](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11532281)
- [What is the best part about being a Software Engineer?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11586779)

I've submited many of those articles to other social media sites(i.e. Reddit) in the past, and they got a good amount of traction. So I was sure that the content was decent. Yet I could not "crack" the Hacker News(HN). Every one of my HN submissions would seem to disappear into the abyss. 

I am pretty sure I am not alone in this situation, so I wanted to share some of the tips that helped me to finally get to the front page of Hacker News.

## 1. Write Quality Content

This may seem common sense, but there is just no sabsitute for it. Quality Content is what matters. No tips or tricks will replace writing something interesting or helpful.

My first post to make it to the front page of Hacker News was definitely one of the best articles I've ever writtened - [I Tried to Virtually Stalk Mark Zuckerberg ](http://www.alexkras.com/i-tried-to-virtually-stalk-mark-zuckerberg/). I started working on it in late December of 2016, and did not publish it until April of 2017. So it was about 4 months in the making.

I took my time to scrape the data, analize it, and present my findings in an easy to digest way. I worked on it, an hour here and there for many day. Eventually my wife agreed to let me dispsapear to a coffee shop for half of a Sunday, allowing me to to finish it up and finally post it late at night.

I got home around 9pm on Sunday, had my wife proof read everything one more time, published it, and submitted to hacker news.

And that is when the magic happened. 

My post took off.

Withing an hour it was the number one post on Hacker News. I don't think I slept much that night.

That is not to say that all posts that make it to the front page of Hacker News are that long or took that long (or longer) to write. [What is the best part about being a Software Engineer](http://www.alexkras.com/what-is-the-best-part-about-being-a-software-engineer/) for example, took me only a few hours to put together.

The point it is, try to wrtie something that you would read yourself, if you saw it on Hacker News.
