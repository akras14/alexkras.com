I've had a number of posts make it to the front page of Hacker News in the past year, including:

- [I Tried to Virtually Stalk Mark Zuckerberg ](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11419800)
- [Git Tips](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11532281)
- [What is the best part about being a Software Engineer?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11586779)

I've submited many of those articles to other social media sites(i.e. Reddit) in the past, and they got a good amount of traction. So I was sure that the content was decent. Yet I could not "crack" the Hacker News(HN). Every one of my HN submissions would seem to disappear into the abyss. 

I am pretty sure I am not alone in this situation, so I wanted to share some of the tips that helped me to finally get to the front page of Hacker News.

## 1. Write Quality Content

This may seem common sense, but there is just no sabsitute for it. Quality Content is what matters. No tips or tricks will replace writing something interesting or helpful.

My first post to make it to the front page of Hacker News was definitely one of the best articles I've ever writtened - [I Tried to Virtually Stalk Mark Zuckerberg ](http://www.alexkras.com/i-tried-to-virtually-stalk-mark-zuckerberg/). I started working on it in late December of 2016, and did not publish it until April of 2017. So it was about 4 months in the making.

I took my time to scrape the data, analize it, and present my findings in an easy to digest way. I worked on it, an hour here and there for many day. Eventually my wife agreed to let me dispsapear to a coffee shop for half of a Sunday, allowing me to to finish it up and finally post it late at night.

I got home around 9pm on Sunday, had my wife proof read everything one more time, published it, and submitted to hacker news.

And that is when the magic happened. 

My post took off.

Withing an hour it was the number one post on Hacker News. I don't think I slept much that night.

That is not to say that all posts that make it to the front page of Hacker News are that long or took that long (or longer) to write. [What is the best part about being a Software Engineer](http://www.alexkras.com/what-is-the-best-part-about-being-a-software-engineer/) for example, took me only a few hours to put together.

The point it is, try to wrtie something that you would read yourself, if you saw it on Hacker News.

## Experiment with Submission Time

I didn't just tell the story of my [Mark Zuckerberg](http://www.alexkras.com/i-tried-to-virtually-stalk-mark-zuckerberg/) article to brag. I think there is something special that happened there, that made a lot of difference. Did you catch it?

I've submited the artilcle around 9pm Pacific Standard Time on Sunday afternoon. It was purely by accident. I finished it, so I posted it. However, I believe that submitting at this day and time was crucial to it's success.

About month after my successful submission, I came across this article - [Best Time to Post? Itâ€™s Irrelevant](https://antontarasenko.com/2015/04/23/best-time-to-post-its-irrelevant/). While the article implies that time of submission to Hacker News is irrelevant, I tend to disagree.

The number of submissions goes down during weekends and after business hours (US). The number of readers is likely to go down as well, but there are still a lot of people reading Hacker News all over the world. Most importantly, an upvote from somebody in (let's say) Mumbai, India, is just as important as an upvote from somebody from San Francisco,California. 

In my experience, all esle being equqal, submitting during the off hours increases the ods of my articles taking off on Hacker News.

This is not to say that this is a hard rule and everybody should submit on 9pm PST on Sunday. However, I do think it is important to experiment with various times of submissions, to find out what works the best for you.

## Aim for a Wider Audience

Hacker News is a community of developers, with no particular specialization. I believe that article that can benefit wider audience do better on Hacker News.

For example, Mark Zuckerberg is a persona that a lot of people care about. Git is a technology that most developers are forced to use these days.

To contract and article about Angular Js for example, would only be interesting to a Front End community. Even there, only those people still using the particular version of Angular JS might care about this particular audience. 

That is not to say that article about Angular JS have no value. I've submitted [11 Tips to Improve AngularJS Performance](http://www.alexkras.com/11-tips-to-improve-angularjs-performance/) to [/r/javascript](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/344ql0/11_tips_to_improve_angularjs_performance/) and got a healthy amount of traffic from there. But that article is not a good candidate for Hacker News, so I don't feel too back that I was not able to get it trending there.

## First 30 Minutes Decide Everything

You chance to shine is the first 30 minutes that your article appeared in [https://news.ycombinator.com/newest](https://news.ycombinator.com/newest). In that time, you article needs to get at least 4 upvotes from different users on different IPs, that saw your article in a line up in [https://news.ycombinator.com/newest](https://news.ycombinator.com/newest) ([source](http://alexstechthoughts.com/post/29406022580/how-to-get-on-the-frontpage-of-hacker-news)) in order for Hacker News to start showing it to a larger audience. 

**You must do everything in you power to get as many people as possible to read (and hopefully like) your article.**

### Headline Matters!

Your headline is the only thing visible on Hacker News. Whatever it is, make sure it something that will pick users interest.

I've tried submitting my [Git Tips](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11532281) with it's original title of "19 tips for everyday Git use" and nobody cared. Perhaps the title was too long.

**Warning** Hacker News can and will moderate your headline, if it does not align well with the content of the article. 

There are hunderds of thousands of articles dedicated to [writing catchy headlines](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+write+a+catchy+headline&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS702US702&oq=how+to+write+a+catchy+headline&aqs=chrome..69i57.4946j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and I can't recommend anything in particular.

One tip that I will give, however, is to use [Hacker News History Search](https://hn.algolia.com) to look for similar articles that where successful in the past, and trying to adopt the headlines that they've used.
  

### Improve Other Signals

We are so overwhelmed with information, that we don't have enough bandwidth to give our attentions to everything. That is why we are forced to look for "signals" that some information that we see is important. 

On Hacker news such signals come in 5 forms:

- Position on the First Page (irrelevant to new articles) 
- Number of upvotes
- Number of comments
- Rate of upvotes (i.e. 200 upovtes / per hour)
- Rate of comments (i.e. 200 comments / per hour)

The more positive signals your article has, the more likely people to read it. There fore it is a good idea to try to improve those signals for your newly submitted articles.

#### Fuel The Discussion
If somebody comments on your article, consider joining into the discussion. Your response will increase the comment count, and may entice others to participate in the discussion.

That being said, at times I found it more useful to just post my article and stay out of the discussion all together. There are a lot of smart people on Hacker News and a lot of people with strong opinions. I generally try to contribute in the discussion only if I have something meaningful to say. 

#### Share it with Followers and Friends

While Hacker News (appears to be)[http://alexstechthoughts.com/post/29406022580/how-to-get-on-the-frontpage-of-hacker-news] smart enough not to counting upvotes that came from a direct HN link, those upvotes would still look like positive signals to your potential readers. For that reason I believe it is beneficial to share your article with your friends and follower on other social media sites.

## Don't be Afraid to Re-Submit

Last but not least, Hacker News has no limit on how many times an article can be submitted. If your article did not take off on the first try, don't be afraid to re-submit. 

It may feel a bit too "self promotional" to keep re-posting your article. I would encourage you to fight off that feeling.

If you invested your time into writing a good, helpful article, there is not shame it trying put it in front of potential readers, who likely will benefit from it. 

If anything, once your article finally makes it to the front page of Hacker News, I am sure you'll find a lot of people thanking you for it.
