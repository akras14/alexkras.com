If you've never heard of a [Debt Snowball](https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/get-out-of-debt-with-the-debt-snowball-plan/) approach for getting out of debt, invented by [Dave Ramsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Ramsey) you may find this title misleading. While you might have thought that this post will be about how the tech debt snow balls out of the control, I actually wanted to talk about how to get out of the tech debt.

## So What is a Debt Snowball?

Dave Ramsey has a very simple but powerful idea. He advises people to pay off their smallest debts first.

This advice may seem controversial, because the math would suggest that the best thing to do is to pay off the debt with the highest interest rate. That way people will be able to minimize the amount of money they spend getting out of debt.

Dave, however, argues that being in debt has much more to do with human psychology, than it has to do with math. The main goal with using Dave's approach is to build up a good habit first.

For example, let say a person has 3 debts: $500 dollar student load, $1000 car loan, and $1500 on credit card. Let's assume all 3 have same monthly payment of $50 per month, and they have a 5%, 10% and 15% interest rate respectively.

Let say this person has an extra $50 a month to help pay out extra towards their debt.

Dave suggests paying of the student loan first. Because with the original $50 plus $50 extra, the person will be able to pay it off in 5 months.

With the student loan gone, the person will feel great and will be motivated to continue paying of the other debts. In addition, after 5 months that person now will have $100 extra dollars to put towards their second smallest debt - $100 in car loan, which by now would be $750 dollars (1000 - 5*50 of regular payments).

With the new payment of $150 dollars a month, the person will be able to pay off the rest of the car loan in 5 more months. Then after only 10 months they'll have $200 a month available towards paying off their biggest debt.

More importantly, they now have 10 months experience of sticking with paying off their debt, and have just witnessed two thirds of their debts disappear.
