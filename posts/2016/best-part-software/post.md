A week ago I saw an article on Hacker News titled - [What's awful about being a {software engineer, tech lead, manager}?](http://www.onebigfluke.com/2016/04/whats-awful-building-software.html). The article was spot on and it got a lot of attention. It also left me feeling depressed about my profession.

My great grandmother used to say: **"Don't compare yourself to people who have more than you do. Compare to those who have less."**

Her point, I believe, is very important. No matter how much I have or achieve in life, **there is always going to be somebody smarter than me, who has more**. It's easy to get trapped in the negative thoughts and to forget just how good we have it.

That is why I wanted to write down a list of things that I believe are great about being a Software Engineer. Since I don't have a ton of tech lead or management experience, my list will only cover Software Engineering :) .
