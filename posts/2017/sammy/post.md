I was born in the former Soviet Union in the early 80s, shortly before it fell apart. When I was 16 my family immigrate to Israel. A year or so later, my mother literally won a greencard lottery and after three year in Israel, we've immigrated to the United States.

We moved to San Francisco in June of 2001, 2 months before the 9/11. 6 months after 9/11 I've enlisted in United States Marine Coprs, leaving for bootcamp in September of 2002. I did two deployment to Iraq, most notebly participating in the Second Battle of Fallujah.

Most of my itme in Fallujha was spent with a small group of Marines (10 men squad; normally 12, but we were short on people), one Navy Corpsman attached to our squad, and an Iraqi interpretter - Sammy. Sammy was actually attached to our platton (3 squads) and he was flactuating between squads on as needed basis.

Sammy, of course, wasn't his real name. All of the interpreters picked an American name to make it easier for us to interact with them and to help them preserver their anonymity. 

I believe Sammy took only one vacation for about a week during  the whole 7 months that I've spent in Iraq. Taking vacation for an interpretor working with the US Military was a very risky undertaking. They went through a great effort to make sure they had a good cover story on why they were gone for so long. It was very common for interpreters or member of their families to get killed in a retaliation for working with Americans.

One time I've asked Sammy how much he was making per month and he said about $500. While this might be a respectable ammount of money in Iraq in 2004, I asked him why he bothered risking his life and the life of his family for relativly small ammount of money. His response was - I want to do what is best for my country. He honestly believe that the Americans could bring real change to Iraq and wnated to do his part, knowing very well the risks involved. 

We've spent so much time with Sammy that it was hard to distinguish him from one of us. He wore the same uniformed. We lived, slept, ate and fought together. I think the only thing that gave him away was his facial hair and the fact that he did not carry a weapon.

Sammy has been working with Americans for about a year befor I got to Iraq and he remained to serve with our replacemte, after our 7 month deployment was up.

I have been thinking a lot about Sammy since. I did two tours in Iraq, after wich I got to return to my adopted home. I got to go to college using the GI Bill money and was able to build a great life for myself. I serverd in Iraq for a total of one year and one month. I was just a green card holder at the time of my deployments, who has only lived in the United States for less than 3 years.

Sammy, was very similar to me, with the exception that he has spent a lot longer time workign for US Goverment in Iraq, and I was lucky enought to have my mother win a green card. Other than that, our service to the United States is very comparable. Yet I got to come back to the United State and Sammy got to stay Iraq.

I don't know what has happend to Sammy since. My hopes is that he somehow was able to find his way to America, after we pulled out of Iraq. I have heard of numerous Iraqi interpreters who were able to get a refugee status, and donated to some causes that are helping them resettle.

Sammy will always continue to be a shining example for me that ALL people can be good or bad. The only right approach, in my opinion, is to judge every individual solely on their actions, and not by any other factors. One person at a time. I've been meaning to share Sammy's story for a while and now seemed like a particularly good time to do it.
