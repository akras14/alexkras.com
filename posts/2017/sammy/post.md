I was born in the former Soviet Union in the early 80s. When I was 16 my family immigrate to Israel. A year or so later, my mother won a Greencard . We moved to San Francisco in June of 2001, 2 months before the 9/11. 6 months after 9/11 I've enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, leaving for bootcamp in September of 2002. I did two tours of duty in Iraq, most notably participating in the Second Battle of Fallujah.

Most of my time in Fallujah was spent with a small group of Marines (10 men squad; normally 12, but we were short on people), one Navy Corpsman attached to our squad, and an Iraqi interpreter - Sammy. Sammy was actually attached to our platoon (3 squads put together) and he was floating between squads on as needed basis.

Sammy, of course, wasn't his real name. All of the interpreters picked an American name to make it easier for us to interact with them and, most importantly, to help them preserver their anonymity.

I believe Sammy took only one vacation for about a week during the whole 7 months that I've spent in Iraq. Taking vacation for an interpreter working with the US Military was a very risky undertaking. They went through a great effort to make sure they had a good cover story (similar to undercover agents) on why they were gone for so long. It was very common for interpreters or member of their families to get killed in a retaliation for working with Americans.

One time I've asked Sammy how much he was making per month and he said about $500. While this might have been a respectable amount of money in Iraq in 2004, I didn't thin it was worth risking his life and the life of his family for it. I asked him, why he would take such a risk, and his response was - I want to do what is best for my country. He honestly believe that the Americans could bring real change to Iraq and wanted to do his part, even knowing the risks involved.

We've spent so much time with Sammy that it was hard to distinguish him from one of us. He wore the same uniforms. We lived, slept, ate, joked and fought together. I think the only thing that gave him away was his facial hair and the fact that he did not carry a weapon.

Sammy has been working with Americans for about a year before I got to Iraq and he remained to serve with our replacements, after our 7 month deployment was up.

I have been thinking a lot about Sammy since. I did two tours in Iraq, after which I got to return to my adopted home. I got to go to college using the GI Bill and was able to build a great life for myself. I served in Iraq for a total of one year and one month. I was just a green card holder at the time of my deployments, who has only lived in the United States for less than 3 years.

Sammy was very similar to me. The two biggest differences between us were that he has spent a lot more time working for the US Government in Iraq and I that was lucky enough to have my mother win the right piece of paper. Other than that, our service to the United States was very comparable. Yet I got to come back to the United State and live a good life and Sammy got to stay Iraq.

I don't know what happened to Sammy since. My hopes is that he somehow was able to find his way to the United States, after our forces pulled out of Iraq. I have heard of numerous Iraqi interpreters who were able to get a refugee status, and I sincerely hope that he was one of them.

Most importantly, Sammy will always continue to be a shining example for me that ALL people can be good or bad. The only right approach, in my opinion, is to judge every individual solely on their actions, and not by their race, religion, gender or any other factors. **One person at a time**. I've been meaning to share Sammy's story for a while now and past few days seemed like a particularly good time to do it.
